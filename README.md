# Arkanoid
A fun java project of the classic arkanoid game, using techniques of OOP and design patterns.

When running the project by default there will be 4 levels, adding the level you wanna play as an arguments is possible.
For instance: sending "2 1 3 4 4 1" as an arguments will play level 2, then 1, 3 etc..
* Notice: level 1 is a guranteed win (that was the requierments).

The game can be paused pressing "p".
